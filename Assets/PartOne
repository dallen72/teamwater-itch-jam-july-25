A man enters a down with a sunken face, drab, dreary and out of place. He asks villagers where the town elder is as they walk by. They all run away scared of the man with a gray face. He approaches a hut unlike the others. It stands a little taller off the ground and has metal edges to mark its distinction. 
	He knocks on the door, “Hello I need to speak with the person in charge.” 

	The door opens and a yellow faced man with a brown hat appears before the man. I would be the town’s elder even if I don’t look the part, what can I do for you Mr?

	“Nomdad you can call me Nomad, I come from a place far away. We need to move quickly if this town has any chance of survival. ;

	“What do you mean survival?”

	“The water is our only chance to fend off evil, do you have anything I can dig with?”

	“Yes, I have a shovel right here, what else do you need?” 

	“That will be all for now, we need to expand your rivers to reach those in need before it is too late, this will be the thing that brightens my face."

	The elder stood in shock and handed him the shovel and watched him leave.
