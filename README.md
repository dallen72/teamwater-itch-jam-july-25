	- setup itch page
	- refactor the nomad script
	- do a better job of showing where the energy is 
	- bug: the user can't escape when the "you won" is shown
	- need to have an explanation for multiple cows (explained to the user) 
	- get rid of button outline when next level is pressed

## Feedback from playtest 8/13:  
	- The simple ui and tutorial is great. the interactive map on the phone could be bigger. consider doing away with the saure map, allowing the entire screen open to play.  
	- in the future, maybe have a "drag feature" for the user to see how much of the metric he is using. 	
	- undo tied to right click would be easier.  
	- Have arrows showing the direction a player can go (the path)  
	- maybe have white line change color as energy lowers  
	- reminds someone of Yoshi's fruit cart from Nintendoland Wii    
	- the last puzzle is a little too tricky  
	- have a line show that previews the line that will be drawn  
	- maybe have a circle that shows the radius of how far the line can be  drawn
